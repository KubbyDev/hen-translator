SPI connection but Chip Select of the Arduino Uno should be connected to reset of the MCU
Power with 5V instead of 3.3V (disconnect 3.3 and connect 5V from arduino)

To load programs onto the chip we can use an arduino uno:

Bootloader burn procedure:
- Switch the MCU power switch to off (the MCU must be disconnected from the battery)
- Connect SS to RESET, MOSI to MOSI, MISO to MISO, SCK to SCK, 5V to 5V, GND to GND
- Load the ArduinoISP example program onto the Arduino
- Select Atmega328 8 MHz internal clock (might have to update your boards.txt) under Board
- Select Arduino as ISP under Programmer
- Tools > Burn Bootloader
- Done

To load a program:
- Remove the ATmega238P from the arduino
- Switch the MCU power switch to off (the MCU must be disconnected from the battery)
- Connect RESET to RESET, RX to RX, TX to TX, 5V to 5V, GND to GND
- Select Atmega328 8 MHz internal clock under Board
- Select AVRISP mkII under Programmer (We now use the programmer chip on the UNO)
- Click Upload
- Done
