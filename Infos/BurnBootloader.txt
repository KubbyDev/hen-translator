SPI connection but Chip Select of the Arduino Uno should be connected to reset of the MCU
Power with 5V instead of 3.3V (disconnect 3.3 and connect 5V from arduino)

Bootloader burn procedure:
- Switch the MCU power switch to off (the MCU must be disconnected from the battery)
- Connect SS to RESET, MOSI to MOSI, MISO to MISO, SCK to SCK, 5V to 5V, GND to GND
- Burn bootloader using Arduino IDE
- Done

To load a program:
Same SPI connection with the switch turned off and upload like a regular arduino
